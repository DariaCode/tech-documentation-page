            <article>
                <p>HTML (<i>Hypertext Markup Language</i>) is not a programming language; it is a markup language used
                    to tell your browser how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple
                    as the web developer wishes it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to
                    enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way. The
                    enclosing tags can make a bit of content into a hyperlink to link to another page on the web,
                    italicize words, and so on. For example, take the following line of content:</p>
                <code> 1 | My cat is very grumpy</code>
                <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in
                    a paragraph (&#60;p&#62;) element:</p>
                <code> 1 | &#60;p&#62;My cat is very grumpy&#60;/p&#62;</code>
            </article>

        <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_element">
            <header id="hd">Anatomy of an HTML element</header>
            <article>
                <p>Let's explore our paragraph element a bit further.The main parts of our element are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>The opening tag:</b> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in
                        opening and closing <b>angle brackets.</b> This states where the element begins or starts to
                        take effect — in this case where the start of the paragraph is.</li>
                    <li><b>The closing tag:</b> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward
                        slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the end
                        of the paragraph is. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error and can lead to
                        strange results.</li>
                    <li><b>The content:</b> This is the content of the element, which in this case is just text.</li>
                    <li><b>The element:</b> The opening tag plus the closing tag plus the content equals the element.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h1>Nesting elements</h1>
                <p>You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called <b>nesting</b>. If we wanted to state
                    that our cat is <b>very</b> grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a &#60;strong&#62; element,
                    which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:</p>
                <code> 1 | &#60;p&#62;My cat is &#60;strong>very&#60;/strong&#62; grumpy.&#60;/p&#62;</code>
                <p>You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested: in the example above, we
                    opened the <i>p</i> element first, then the <i>strong</i> element, therefore we have to close the
                    <i>strong</i> element first, then the <i>p</i>. The following is incorrect:</p>
                <code> 1 | &#60;p&#62;My cat is &#60;strong>very grumpy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;/strong&#62;</code>
                <p>The elements have to open and close correctly, so they are clearly inside or outside one another. If
                    they overlap like above, then your web browser will try to make a best guess at what you were trying
                    to say, and you may well get unexpected results. So don't do it!</p>
                <h1>Block versus inline elements</h1>
                <p>There are two important categories of elements in HTML which you should know about. They are
                    block-level elements and inline elements.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Block-level elements form a visible block on a page — they will appear on a new line from
                        whatever content went before it, and any content that goes after it will also appear on a new
                        line. Block-level elements tend to be structural elements on the page that represent, for
                        example, paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, footers, etc. A block-level element wouldn't be
                        nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested inside another block-level element.</li>
                    <li>Inline elements are those that are contained within block-level elements and surround only small
                        parts of the document’s content, not entire paragraphs and groupings of content. An inline
                        element will not cause a new line to appear in the document; they would normally appear inside a
                        paragraph of text, for example an &#60;a&#62; element (hyperlink) or emphasis elements such as
                        &#60;em&#62; or &#60;strong&#62;.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Take the following example:</p>
                <code>1 |
                    &#60;em&#62;first&#60;/em&#62;&#60;em&#62;second&#60;/em&#62;&#60;em&#62;third&#60;/em&#62;<br>2 |
                    <br>3 | &#60;p&#62;fourth&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;fifth&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;fifth&#60;/p&#62;</code>
                <p>&#60;em&#62; is an inline element, so as you can see below, the first three elements sit on the same
                    line as one another with no space in between. On the other hand, &#60;p&#62; is a block-level
                    element, so each element appears on a new line, with space above and below each (the spacing is due
                    to default CSS styling that the browser applies to paragraphs).</p>
                <h1>Empty elements</h1>
                <p>Not all elements follow the above pattern of opening tag, content, closing tag. Some elements consist
                    only of a single tag, which is usually used to insert/embed something in the document at the place
                    it is included. For example, the &#60;img&#62; element embeds an image file onto a page in the
                    position it is included in:</p>
                <code>1 | &#60;img
                    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png"&#62;</code>
                <p>This would output the following on your page:</p>
                <img id="picmz"
                    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png">
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Attributes">
            <header id="hd">Attributes</header>
            <article>
                <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element which you don't want to appear in the actual
                    content. In this case, the class attribute allows you to give the element an identifying name that
                    can be later used to target the element with style information and other things.</p>
                <p>An attribute should have:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has
                        one or more attributes).</li>
                    <li>The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.</li>
                    <li>An attribute value, with opening and closing quote marks wrapped around it.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Another example of an element is &#60;a&#62; — this stands for "anchor" and will make the piece of
                    text it wraps around into a hyperlink. This can take a number of attributes, but several are as
                    follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>href:</b> This attribute specifies as its value the web address that you want the link to
                        point to; where the browser navigates to when the link is clicked. For example,
                        href="https://www.mozilla.org/".</li>
                    <li><b>title:</b> The title attribute specifies extra information about the link, such as what the
                        page is that you are linking to. For example, title="The Mozilla homepage". This will appear as
                        a tooltip when hovered over.</li>
                    <li><b>target:</b> The target attribute specifies the browsing context which will be used to display
                        the link. For example, target="_blank" will display the link in a new tab. If you want to
                        display the link in the current tab just omit this attribute.</li>
                </ul>
                <h1>Boolean attributes</h1>
                <p>You'll sometimes see attributes written without values — this is perfectly allowed. These are called
                    boolean attributes, and they can only have one value, which is generally the same as the attribute
                    name. As an example, take the <b>disabled</b> attribute, which you can assign to form input elements
                    if you want them to be disabled (greyed out) so the user can't enter any data in them.</p>
                <code>1 | &#60;input type="text" disabled="disabled"&#62;</code>
                <p>As shorthand, it is perfectly allowable to write this as follows (we've also included a non-disabled
                    form input element for reference, to give you more of an idea what is going on):</p>
                <code>1 | &#60;!-- using the disabled attribute prevents the end user from entering text into the input
                    box --&#62; <br>2 | &#60;input type="text" disabled&#62; <br>3 | <br>4 | &#60;!-- The user can enter
                    text into the follow input, as it doesn't contain the disabled attribute --&#62; <br>5 | &#60;input
                    type="text"&#62; </code>
                <p>The above HTML will give you a rendered output as follows:</p>
                <input type="text" disabled> <input type="text">
                <h1>Omitting quotes around attribute values</h1>
                <p>When you look around the World Wide Web, you'll come across a number of strange markup styles,
                    including attribute values without quotes. This is allowable in certain circumstances, but will
                    break your markup in others. For example, if we revisit our link example from earlier, we could
                    write a basic version with only the <b>href</b> attribute, like this:</p>
                <code>1 | &#60;a href=https://www.mozilla.org/&#62;favorite website&#60;/a&#62;</code>
                <p>However, as soon as we add the <b>title</b> attribute in this style, things will go wrong:</p>
                <code>1 | &#60;a href=https://www.mozilla.org/ title=The Mozilla homepage&#62;favorite
                    website&#60;/a&#62;</code>
                <p>At this point the browser will misinterpret your markup, thinking that the <b>title</b> attribute is
                    actually three attributes — a title attribute with the value "The", and two boolean attributes,
                    Mozilla and homepage. This is obviously not what was intended, and will cause errors or unexpected
                    behavior in the code, as seen in the live example below. Try hovering over the link to see what the
                    title text is!</p>
                <p>Our advice is to always include the attribute quotes — it avoids such problems, and results in more
                    readable code too.</p>
                <h1>Single or double quotes?</h1>
                <p>In this article you'll notice that the attributes are all wrapped in double quotes. You might however
                    see single quotes in some people's HTML. This is purely a matter of style, and you can feel free to
                    choose which one you prefer. Both the following lines are equivalent:</p>
                <code>1 | &#60;a href="https://www.mozilla.org"&#62;A link to my example.&#60;/a&#62; <br>2 | <br>3 |
                    &#60;a href='https://www.mozilla.org'&#62;A link to my example.&#60;/a&#62;</code>
                <p>You should however make sure you don't mix them together. The following will go wrong!</p>
                <code>1 | &#60;a href="https://www.mozilla.org'&#62;A link to my example.&#60;/a&#62;</code>
                <p>However if you want to include a quote within the quotes where both the quotes are of the same type
                    (single quote or double quote), you'll have to use HTML entities for the quotes. For example, this
                    will break:</p>
                <code>1 | &#60;a href='http://www.example.com' title='Isn't this fun?'&#62;A link to my
                    example.&#60;/a&#62;</code>
                <p>So you need to do this:</p>
                <code>1 | &#60;a href='http://www.example.com' title='Isn&#38;#39&#59;t this fun?'&#62;A link to my
                    example.&#60;/a&#62;</code>

            <article>
                <p>That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't very useful on their own. Now
                    we'll look at how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page:</p>
                <code>1 | &#60;!DOCTYPE html&#62;<br>2 | &#60;html&#62;<br>3 | &#60;head&#62; <br>4 | &#60;meta
                    charset="utf-8"&#62; <br>5 | &#60;title&#62;My test page&#60;/title&#62; <br>6 | &#60;/head&#62;
                    <br>7 | &#60;body&#62; <br>8 | &#60;p&#62;This is my page&#60;/p&#62; <br>9 | &#60;/body&#62; <br>10
                    | &#60;/html&#62;</code>
                <p>Here we have:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>&#60;!DOCTYPE html&#62;</b>: The doctype. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (about
                            1991/2), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to
                            follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other
                            useful things. They used to look something like this:</p>
                        <code>1 | &#60;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"<br>2 |
                            "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"&#62; </code>
                        <p>However, these days no one really cares about them, and they are really just a historical
                            artifact that needs to be included for everything to work right. <b>&#60;!DOCTYPE
                                html&#62;</b> is the shortest string of characters that counts as a valid doctype;
                            that's all you really need to know.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>&#60;html&#62;&#60;/html&#62;</b>: The <b>&#60;html&#62;</b> element. This element wraps all
                        the content on the entire page, and is sometimes known as the root element.</li>
                    <li><b>&#60;head&#62;&#60;/head&#62;</b>: The <b>&#60;head&#62;</b> element. This element acts as a
                        container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are
                        showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that
                        you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and
                        more. You'll learn more about this in the next article in the series.</li>
                    <li><b>&#60;meta charset="utf-8"&#62;</b>: This element sets the character set your document should
                        use to UTF-8, which includes most characters from the vast majority of human written languages.
                        Essentially it can now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to
                        set this, and it can help avoid some problems later.</li>
                    <li><b>&#60;title&#62;&#60;/title&#62;</b>: The <b>&#60;title&#62;</b> element. This sets the title
                        of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in, and is
                        used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.</li>

                <p>In HTML, as with most programming languages, there is a mechanism available to write comments in the
                    code — comments are ignored by the browser and invisible to the user, and their purpose is to allow
                    you to include comments in the code to say how your code works, what the different parts of the code
                    do, etc. This can be very useful if you return to a code base that you've not worked on for six
                    months, and can't remember what you did — or if you hand your code over to someone else to work on.
                </p>
                <p>To turn a section of content inside your HTML file into a comment, you need to wrap it in the special
                    markers &#60;!-- and --&#62;, for example:</p>
                <code>1 | &#60;p&#62;I'm not inside a comment&#60;/p&#62; <br>2 | <br>3 | &#60;!-- &#60;p&#62;I
                    am!&#60;/p&#62; --&#62; </code>
